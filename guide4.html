<p><span>The game has a set of tasks to complete within the relevant day. A total of five daily tasks are provided for you to achieve every day, and when you complete all the tasks, you can earn a big daily chest filled with lots of rewards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, you will be given all the tasks you complete individually, but the daily chest can only be achieved if you finish completing all the daily tasks. As these tasks need to be completed within a day, they are easy to complete and handle. So, as this&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Sigma&nbsp;</span></strong><span>beginner guide suggests, you must achieve all the daily tasks.&nbsp;</span></p>
