<p><span>So when you enter the game as a beginner, the first mode you can enter and available for you is Battle Royale, and if you are familiar with battle royale games, you should know what it is like to join the battle royale mode. In the battle royale, a certain number of players will enter the game solo, in duos, or in squads of four players.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Winning will be challenging in this battle royale because it does not depend on the kills you get, but if you can be the last man standing on the battleground until all the players are eliminated, you will be the winner.&nbsp;</span></p>
