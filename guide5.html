<p><span>There are no more characters in this game, but only a male and a female character for you to choose from. Even so, we bet there will be more characters in the Characters menu of the&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Sigma</span></strong><span>&nbsp;game shortly. Leveling up the characters is another essential&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Sigma&nbsp;</span></strong><span>tip to be used before you start a match because their skills will be advanced and much more effective when you level up the character.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But to level up these skills in characters, you need character chips or universal chips in a certain amount. You can obtain the necessary items by taking the character you want to level up to the battles. The more you level up the character, the duration of the skill will increase, and the skill cooldown time will reduce.&nbsp;</span></p>
