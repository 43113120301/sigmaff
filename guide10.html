<p><span>There are two ranked mode matches in this game, BR- Ranked and FO-Ranked, and these two will gradually unlock after unlocking the previous mode we talked about, Fight Out. Since these two are ranked modes, they will affect the rank of your gameplay, and if you want to increase your current rank, you should somehow win the ranked matches. And these ranked mode matches will happen in random maps.&nbsp;</span></p>
